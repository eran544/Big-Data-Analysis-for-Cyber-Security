# <b> Big Data Analysis for Cyber Security: Time-Series Analysis mini project </b>
<hr>


### <i> This project's main goal is to train a classifier who can detect malicious files.<br>                                        We detected patterns of clean files versus malicious files in our dataset using time series analysis and pattern extraction methods, and trained a classifier accordingly using machine learning. 
### <i> The dataset we based our work on has been provided us by Microsoft and includes information about downloaded files sent as a webmail attachment in the first 14 days of 2017.
### <i> The project in wiritten in Python, using pandas library for data analysis and sklearn library for machine learning algorithms.
