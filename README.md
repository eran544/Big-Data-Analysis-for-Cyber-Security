## Big Data Analysis for Cyber Security: mini project

This project's main goal is to train a classifier who can detect malicious files.
In order to do so we tried to detect patterns of clean files versus malicious files using time series analysis and pattern extraction methods on our data set,
and train a classifier accordingly using machine learning.
The data set provided by Microsoft includes information about downloaded files sent as a webmail attachment in the first 14 days of 2017.

The project in wiritten in Python, using pandas library for data analysis and sklearn library for machine learning algorithms.
